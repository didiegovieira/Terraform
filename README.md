> [!NOTE]
> Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently through code.

> [!TIP]
> It leverages Infrastructure as Code (IaC), enabling versioning, idempotence, and reusable high-level syntax.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Terraform facilitates execution plans for secure and predictable infrastructure changes, separating planning from application.

> [!WARNING]
> It's crucial to note that Terraform is vendor-agnostic, allowing deployment to multiple providers simultaneously.

> [!CAUTION]
> While Terraform offers numerous advantages, it's essential to understand its differences from other configuration management tools like Ansible, Puppet, and Chef, as well as cloud-specific IaC tools like CloudFormation.

## What is Terraform?
Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently through code.

## Key Features
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
    - Open-source and declarative
    - Supports versioning, idempotence, and reusable syntax
    - Parity across environments
- Execution Plans
    - Secure and predictable infrastructure changes
    - Separation of planning and application
- Hybrid and Agnostic
    - Supports deployment to multiple providers simultaneously

## Use Cases
- Provisioning new infrastructure
- Managing existing infrastructure
- Replicating infrastructure

## How Does Terraform Work?
- Terraform Core utilizes two sources of input:
    - Your configuration files (desired state)
    - The current state managed by Terraform
- Providers expose resources, enabling infrastructure creation across various platforms:
    - IaaS: AWS, GCP, Azure
    - PaaS: Kubernetes, Heroku, Digital Ocean
    - SaaS: New Relic, Datadog

## Terraform vs. Other Software
Terraform serves as a high-level infrastructure orchestration tool, differing from other configuration management tools like Ansible, Puppet, and Chef, as well as cloud-specific IaC tools like CloudFormation.
